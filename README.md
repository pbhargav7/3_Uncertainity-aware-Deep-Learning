    - Problem 1: What is the problem that the paper aims to solve, and why is this problem important or interesting? Answer this question in two sentences. (5 points) 
    
    - Problem 2: What is the meaning of “distance awareness”? How do the authors achieve “distance awareness”? Answer this question in two sentences. (15 points) 
    
    - Problem 3: Design and implement a toy experiment to showcase the effect of “spectral normalization”. (20 points) 
    
    - Problem 4: Reproduce the toy experiment (Figure 1 (f),(i),(j)) in the paper. You need to output the three figures. (30 points) 
    
    - Problem 5: Conduct the same sets of experiments as Problem 4 on the mixture of 8 Gaussians and 25 Gaussians respectively. These Gaussians can be either identical or with different parameters at your choice. You need to output six pictures. (50 points)
